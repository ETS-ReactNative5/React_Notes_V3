<h1 id="a-basic-component">A Basic Component</h1>
<p>The key abstraction that React provides is that of a component. To reiterate, a component is some thing that is being rendered in the browser. It could be a button, a form with a bunch of fields in it, a navigation bar at the top of the page, a single input field, etc. Any of these could be its own component. React doesn’t place any restrictions on how large or small a component can be. You <em>could</em> have an entire static site encapsulated in a single React component, but that at that point you may as well not be using React. So the first thing to remember about a component is that a component must <em>render</em> something. If nothing is being rendered from a component, then React will throw an error.</p>
<p>Let’s write the most basic of components we can possibly write. Inside of <code>BasicComponent.js</code>, first import React at the top of the file. Our most basic of components looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>import React from &#39;react&#39;;

const BasicComponent = () =&gt; &lt;div&gt;Hello World!&lt;/div&gt;;

export default BasicComponent;</code></pre>
<p>This is a component that simply returns a div tag with the words Hello World! inside. The last line simply exports our component so that it can be imported by another file.</p>
<p>Notice that this component looks exactly like an anonymous arrow function that we’ve named <code>BasicComponent</code>. In fact, that is literally what this is. Nothing more, nothing less. The arrow function then is simply returning the div tag. When a component is written as a function like this one is, it is called a <em>functional</em> component.</p>
<p>While a component can of course get a lot more complicated than this, fundamentally, all a component does is render some HTML.</p>
