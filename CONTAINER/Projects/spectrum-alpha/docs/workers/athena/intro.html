<h1 id="athena">Athena</h1>
<p><em>Athena (/əˈθiːnə/) is the goddess of wisdom, craft, and war.</em></p>
<p>Athena is our notifications worker, processing things like new message notifications, new thread notifications, new member notifications, etc. Athena is built to read off of our <a href="../background-jobs.md">Redis queue</a>. Most queues in Athena handle the sending of both in-app notifications as well as email notifications (by dispatching a new job to the Redis queue for <a href="../hermes/intro.md">Hermes</a> to read).</p>
<p>This server also does the heavy lifting of keeping track of the <code>lastSeen</code> field on <code>usersThreads</code>, which is what powers the small ‘New Messages’ badge that users see when viewing threads on Spectrum. While not directly a notification, the <code>lastSeen</code> field is a critical piece of Spectrum that helps people keep up with the most important and active conversations in their communities.</p>
