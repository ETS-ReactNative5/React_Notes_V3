<h2 id="infinite-jest">Infinite Jest</h2>
<p>I am seated in an office, surrounded by heads and bodies. There I’ve written some tests for this package, using Facebook’s Jest library<small><sup>1</sup></small>, which provides automatic mocking and jsdom testing.</p>
<p>Tests are located in the <code>__tests__</code> directory<small><sup>2</sup></small>, and can be run with <code>npm test</code> after <code>npm install</code>.</p>
<h2 id="developing">Developing</h2>
<p>React Infinite is built with Browserify and Gulp. To get started, install the development dependencies with <code>npm install</code>. If you do not already have Gulp, you might wish to install it globally with <code>npm install -g gulp</code>.</p>
<p>The newly revamped development environment is based on <code>gulp develop</code>. When run, this command sets up a watch on the <code>/src</code> folder with Browserify as well as the <code>examples</code> folder.</p>
<p>The other major command, <code>gulp release</code>, prepares files for release. It produces normal and minified versions of <code>react-infinite.js</code> in the <code>dist</code> folder and also directly transpiles the source to ES5 in the <code>build</code> folder so it can be required by other asset pipelines.</p>
<h3 id="infinite-computers">Infinite Computers</h3>
<p>Extending React Infinite to support different specifications of <code>elementHeight</code>s is now much easier. To do so, write a class that extends the <code>InfiniteComputer</code> and satisfies its interface of five methods (see <code>src/computers/infinite_computer.js</code>). You can consult <code>ConstantInfiniteComputer</code> and <code>ArrayInfiniteComputer</code> to see how constant and variable heights are handled respectively.</p>
<h2 id="future-development">Future Development</h2>
<p>It would be useful for React Infinite to be adapted to any arbitrary two-dimensional grid.</p>
<p><small><sup>1</sup></small> In sum, Jest is a library that provides several layers on top of Jasmine. More information can be found on Facebook’s <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/">Jest page</a>.</p>
<p><small><sup>2</sup></small> The directory name is specified by Jest. Tests can be written in JSX because they are first run through a preprocessor that compiles them to plain Javascript.</p>
