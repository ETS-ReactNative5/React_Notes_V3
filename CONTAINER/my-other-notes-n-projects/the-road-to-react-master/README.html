<p>You can help to improve the book by opening Issues and Pull Requests (PR).</p>
<p>You can open up any PR that corrects spelling or explains a certain lesson with more detail. When writing such a technical book, you get fast blind on what needs more explanation and on what is already explained well.</p>
<p>In addition, you can open Issues when you run into problems. In order to make the fix for the Issue as easy as possible, please provide a couple of details such as error log, screenshot, which page of the book it happened, your node version (command line: <code>node -v</code>) and a link to your own repository. Not all of these details are mandatory, but most of them help to fix the Issue and to improve the book.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your help!</p>
